syd
===

This is a work in progress text editor, that will hopefully someday replace
my current editor of choice (vim) as I'm no longer happy with it, or with any
other text editor for that matter.

Syd will eventually implement nearly all of the Acme editor features, and
some small amount of fundamental vim features I can't live without (and
therefore can't just use Acme).
